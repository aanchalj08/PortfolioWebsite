    overview:"The primary purpose of this project is to serve as a comprehensive showcase of my skills and professional journey. It encompasses all the necessary information regarding my experience and accomplishments thus far. The website itself is designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes. The user interface (UI) of the website has been thoughtfully crafted with a focus on simplicity. Every element and layout choice has been carefully considered to ensure a clean and user-friendly design. It is important to note that this project is not a code-along tutorial; it is a result of my own design and coding efforts. The website serves as a testament to my ability to not only design visually appealing interfaces but also implement them through coding.",

    overview:"The Food Ordering Website is a project created to learn and apply core concepts of React while building a practical and functional web application. The website allows users to browse through various food options and place orders seamlessly.One notable feature of this project is the integration of a Firebase API for storing and retrieving card data. When users finalize their order and proceed to checkout, their card details, such as the selected food items, quantities, and any additional preferences, are securely sent to the Firebase API. This integration ensures a smooth and reliable storage mechanism for processing and managing orders.Throughout the development process, the project aims to demonstrate proficiency in React's core concepts, including component-based architecture, state management, and handling user interactions.
